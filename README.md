Explorer 2
========

This is a very basic file explorer for FirefoxOS. Now it's just a tool to select files to share, and it's hidden from the homescreen.

Extensions with images -by now-: doc, xls, ppt, psd, ai, pdf, html, xml, txt, mp3, jpg, png, zip and ogg.

- THIS IS A FORK - of Sebastian Rajo's Explorer to match the Firefox OS 2.0 redesign (as a popup window in this case).
